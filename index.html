	<div>So I love cows,but I also love pegasus!! If you put them 
    together it make a Mooasus. I know I've said this a lot but.... 
    love coding, it's entertaining,fun, and you get to create and 
    be youself. I will try to keep you posted on every thing

    <div> Hi, this is a MOOASUS. Now  before I get started with this part you can go look at the rest of the mythical creatures like kiticorn,bunnasus,and all the other ones.Now for the good stuff!!!</div>
    <div> I have some exsplaining to do now a Mooasus is a breed of a cow (moo) and a pegasus (asus) whitch make a MOOASUS. I love these mythical cow pegasus creatures. They  are fantastict, amazing, wounderful, and so much more. They can fly because they have wings. They can also MOO because they're part cows. They also are a very kind species(so are all the other ones) and dont bite(I don't know why I inclueded that last part).</div>
    <div> <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mOYGE0w8N5Y/WkVRyzOUWyI/AAAAAAAAAr4/PyiD4rNQcfcIPxf--aGRl6ZT1OYbhFYogCL0BGAYYCw/h1408/a5f6cc34-ecb5-48c2-bfae-c4215982be44" width="200px"/> </div>
    <div> Now there is a symbol that I tend to draw on my left wrist most days( sometimes I forget to draw it). As you can see from the picture above that is my symbol. The reason my symbol has a part that is PINK wings, is because my favorite color is pink. Also if  had to get a tatoo that symbol would be what I would choose to get, and I would get it on my left wrist. But I just stick to drawing it with a fine point sharpie and highlighters for color. I hope you have enjoyed the Mooasus section and I hope you will also enjoy my other mythical breeds( I might not write as much in the other breeds)! But this is a fun way to learn new things about new mythical creatures.</div>
