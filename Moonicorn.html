      left , and the girl on the right side is one of my best friends!!(in the picture above)</div> 
		<div> I live in Utah, I love  my little brother even when he's annoying. I  
      love all my family. I love science and coding. I also love cows and 
      pegasus!!!</div>

      I enjoy codeing because it challenges me and its fun.  </div>

	<div>So I love cows,but I also love pegasus!! If you put them 
    together it make a Mooasus. I know I've said this a lot but.... 
    love coding, it's entertaining,fun, and you get to create and 
    be youself. I will try to keep you posted on every thing

    <div> Hi, this is a MOONICORN. Now  before I get started with this part you can go look at the rest of the mythical creatures like kiticorn,bunnasus,and all the other ones.Now for the good stuff!!!</div>
    <div> I have some exsplaining to do now a Moonicorn is a breed of a cow (moo) and a pegasus (icorn) whitch make a MOOICORN. I love these mythical cow unicorn creatures. They  are fantastict, amazing, wounderful, and so much more. They can create magical things. They can also MOO because they're part cows. They also are a very kind species(so are all the other ones) and dont bite(I don't know why I inclueded that last part).</div>
    <div> <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UsQc4TIebrM/WjROdEsXdiI/AAAAAAAAAok/q3Ld0birWQEX3hCwQyvcARXDgd9Tq-w4gCL0BGAYYCw/h457/4c2c63a3-676f-4df0-939e-ed5e5b3d5bc3" width="200px"/> </div>
    <div> Now there is a symbol that my friend Ivy draws on her wtis. As you can see from the picture above that is her symbol. The reason her symbol has rainbows is because unicorns love rainbows. She and all my other friends wear it on there left wrist. But she uses fine point sharpie and highlighters for color. I hope you have enjoyed the Moonicorn section and I hope you will also enjoy my other mythical breeds( I might not write as much in the other breeds)! But this is a fun way to learn new things about new mythical creatures.</div>
